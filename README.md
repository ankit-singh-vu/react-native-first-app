### Step 3: Install Expo Go on Your Phone
- **Android**: Download "Expo Go" from Google Play Store
- **iPhone**: Download "Expo Go" from App Store

### Step 4: Start the App
```bash
npm start
```

### Step 5: Scan QR Code
- A QR code will appear in your terminal
- Open Expo Go on your phone
- **Android**: Tap "Scan QR Code" and scan the code
- **iPhone**: Open Camera app and scan the code, then tap the Expo Go notification

That's it! Your app should now be running on your phone! ðŸŽ‰
